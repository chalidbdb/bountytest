# Howto's for Bounties with Github and Gitcoin

## Abstract
This documentation describes activities that are performed to define, publish and reward for issues fixed in [Github](https://github.com/) repos. The bounty and reward process is based on the [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) platform that integrates with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to pay in ETH or ERC20 compliant tokens. A smart contract based on [Standard Bounties](https://medium.com/gitcoin/integrating-standard-bounties-dc4cf62bf814) implementation integrates.
